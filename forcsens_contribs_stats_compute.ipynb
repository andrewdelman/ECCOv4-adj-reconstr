    "# Quantifying contributions of surface forcing to sea level reconstructions and hindcasts, using ECCO adjoint sensitivities\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Delman, updated 2025-06-27\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is the starting point for computing sea level contributions from surface forcings (freshwater flux, heat flux, zonal wind stress, meridional wind stress) and associated statistics (e.g., variance, variance explained). When running this notebook, a few Python modules are used which are contained in the `contribs_modules` folder. In order for the modules to be loaded, the `contribs_modules` folder should be included in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input settings\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the settings that would typically be modified by the user are contained between approximately lines 30 and 380 of the code cell below. This includes parameters such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifiers to identify which types of datasets are being used as pre-initialization (ECCO, ERA5, JRA55-do) or post-initialization (CESM model) forcings. This assumes the data have already been aggregated to weekly means on the ECCO LLC90 model grid. Separate scripts are available in this repository to perform this aggregation and conservative regridding.\n",
    "- Specifiers for adjoint sensitivity location and maximum lead time to be used.\n",
    "- Specifiers of years to be included in sea level reconstructions, and whether to remove time mean and trend from reference time series.\n",
    "- Whether to archive the cell contributions for each year, or only the statistics (variance/variance explained) for each cell.\n",
    "- The (local) parent directories where the necessary datasets (adjoint sensitivities, forcings, reference time series if used) can be found.\n",
    "- The output directory and \"store\" name (in `zarr` format) for the computed sea level contributions and statistics\n",
    "- Specifiers for any reference time series (optional): observations (altimetry, tide gauges), reconstruction time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cell \"geometry\" used to aggregate the impacts from individual ECCO grid cells into larger \"cells\". Aggregating contributions into larger \"cells\" or regions can save time and storage space on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the comments in the code for additional information about these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cell geometry schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry for cell aggregations can be specified in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No aggregation `{'n_merge':1}`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list_nested = []\n",
    "new_scheme = {'n_merge':1}\n",
    "already_covered = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nested geometry. For example the specification:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list_nested = []\n",
    "# create entry for 1x1 cells (no merging)\n",
    "new_scheme = {'n_merge':1,'tile':{10:{'j':np.arange(30,90),'i':np.arange(45,90)}}}\n",
    "list_nested.append(new_scheme)\n",
    "# create entry for 3x3 cells\n",
    "new_scheme = {'n_merge':3,'tile':{10:{'j':np.arange(0,90),'i':np.arange(0,90)},\\\n",
    "                                  11:{'j':np.arange(0,90),'i':np.arange(0,30)},\\\n",
    "                                  2:{'j':np.arange(0,45),'i':np.arange(0,30)}}}\n",
    "list_nested.append(new_scheme)\n",
    "# create entry for 10x10 cells (remainder of domain)\n",
    "new_scheme = {'n_merge':10}\n",
    "already_covered = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "  tells the code to compute contributions for individual ECCO cells (no aggregation) for tile 10,\n",
    "  j indices 30-90, and i indices 45-90, corresponding roughly to the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, \n",
    "  and NW tropical and mid-Atlantic. \n",
    "  Then cells are aggregated 3x3 in \n",
    "  the rest of tile 10 (N America and W Atlantic), \n",
    "  for tile 11 i indices 0-30 (far southern Caribbean and equatorial region), \n",
    "  and tile 2 j indices 0-45, i indices 0-30 (NE tropical and mid-Atlantic).\n",
    "  Finally, cells are aggregated 10x10 in the rest of the global domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Region specification. You can also be more specific and specify the aggregated \"cells\" by latitude or longitude limits, to have oblique/diagonal boundaries, or even have distance from a coastline as a boundary. As an example, the `Gulf_NAtl` regional scheme is used in the sea level attribution manuscript, and you can see how this geometry was constructed by looking at the `Gulf_NAtl_regional_scheme` function in the `nested_geoms.py` module. The order of the regions specified matters: if a region is specified first and then another region is specified that overlaps with the first, the first region is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first code cell below which runs the computation, the second grid cell gives you a sense of the format of the output dataset and associated `zarr` store. (`zarr` is an efficient format for storing and reading data that often reduces the size footprint on disk by a factor of 2-5 vs. `netcdf`, and also is typically faster to read into memory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates in the dataset `ds_forcsens` indicate:\n",
    "- Times used in adjoint sensitivity computations, forcing, and prediction/reconstruction.\n",
    "- Latitude (`YC`) and longitude (`XC`) of the ECCO native grid cell centers.\n",
    "- Latitude (`YG`) and longitude (`XG`) of the ECCO native grid cell min j/min i corner.\n",
    "- A `cell_indexing` array that maps the aggregated \"cell\" scheme onto the original ECCO LLC90 grid.\n",
    "- Latitude (`YC_cell`) and longitude (`XC_cell`) means in the aggregated \"cells\".\n",
    "- Latitude (`YG_cell`) and longitude (`XG_cell`) corners of the aggregated \"cells\" (may not be accurate for cell schemes with oblique boundaries such as `Gulf_NAtl`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "The array `rA_cell` contains the horizontal area in the aggregated \"cells\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code was run with `cell_impact_years_save = True`, the data variables will include the array `preinit_cell_impact_attimes` which can be quite large and contains the sea level contributions from each \"cell\", for each forcing type and lead time, at each month and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other statistics can all be derived from `preinit_cell_impact_attimes`, and `obs_tseries_sortmonth` which is the reference time series reshaped so that the month and year dimensions are aligned with the other arrays in the dataset. If a post-initialization forcing is used (from a prediction model), it will be stored in `postinit_cell_impact_attimes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code was run with `cell_impact_years_save = False` to save storage space, the `preinit_cell_impact_attimes` array is omitted, but the derived statistics such as variance or variance explained can still be seen in the data variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For prediction applications, the array `predict_lead_mo` has the predicted sea level at `pred_month` and `pred_year` based on the provided pre- and post-initialization forcings, as a function of the lead time (in months) of the prediction."
